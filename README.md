# UFOs

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to update the web page of UFO sightings so that the user can filter the table based on multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the user can add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


### Tools Used

Visual Studio Code

## Results

- When the user enters a value in the search criteria for the javascript code will filter the table based on that value. For example, when the user types a value "1/10/2010" in the DateTime search criteria and presses the enter key, the table is filtered to include the UFO sightings from the date "1/10/2010".
- The following image illustrates using only one search criteria at a time.

- The user can narrow down the search criteria by adding multiple criteria such as city, state, country, and shape at the same time, to obtain the specific data. 

- The following image provides an example of the filtered table when two search criteria are used at the same time. In the image, I have used the DateTime filter to search for the UFO sightings on date "1/1/2010" and shape "light".

- To remove all the filters and add new search criteria, the user can refresh the page.

## Summary 
- One drawback of the webpage is that there is no information obtained on the number of the results obtained after the filter. The user has to manually count the number of results obtained.
- we further improve the results by adding search criteria based on duration and including results obtained information at the bottom of the page.
